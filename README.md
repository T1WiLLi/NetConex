# NetConex

NetConex is a Java library that provides easy-to-use functionality for making HTTP requests, handling errors, and configuring timeouts and retries.

## Features

- Supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE HTTP methods.
- Asynchronous request execution.
- Customizable timeout configuration.
- Retry mechanism for failed requests.
- Error handling improvements.

## Installation

I'm currently working on that, but it will soon be available on Maven Central :)
In the meantime, you can use the .Jar file (it's a modular library) so you will need to include a module-info.java
